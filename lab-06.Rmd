### Load packages and data

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse) 
library(dsbox)
library(mosaicData) 
```

```{r}
library(usethis)
use_git_config(user.name = "Lindsay Stall", 
               user.email = "stallm21@wfu.edu")
```

```{r}
staff <- read_csv("data/instructional-staff.csv")
```
```{r}
staff_long <- staff %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -faculty_type, names_to = "year") %>%
  mutate(value = as.numeric(value))
```

```{r}
staff_long
```
### Exercise 1

```{r}
staff_long %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year,
             y = value,
             group = faculty_type,
             color = faculty_type,)) +
  labs(
    x = "Years",
    y = "Faculty type",
    title = "Faculty Type by Year"
  ) +
  geom_line()
```

### Exercise 2

I would create 2 groups: one for part-time and one for full time to make the rates of employment between the groups easier to compare. 

### Exercise 3

...

Add exercise headings as needed.
